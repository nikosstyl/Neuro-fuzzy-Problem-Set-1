\section{Problem 2}
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent defined by the negative value of the gradient. It is mostly used to update the parameters of models.\\
In this exercise we need to execure two iterations of the Gradient Descent to the function
\begin{center}
$	f(x_1,x_2) = (x_1+2 \cdot x_2 - 7)^2 + (2 \cdot x_1 + x_2 -5)^2$
\end{center}
with initial point $x_0 = (-9.5,9.5)$.

The steps that we must use each time are specific.
\begin{center}
	\textit{FIRST ITERATION k = 0}
\end{center}
\underline{Step1: Calculate the Gradient}

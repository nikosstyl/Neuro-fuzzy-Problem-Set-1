\section{Problem 8}
ADALINE is a single-layer artificial neural network that can learn and adapt to non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. \\
It consists of a single neuron with a linear activation function. Each input of the neuron has a corresponding weight,which is adapted during training to minimize the error between the network's output and the desired output. To adjust the weights the algorithm uses the learning rule Î±.

Suppose that we have the following three reference patterns and their targets:

\[
\left\{ 
p1 = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
	2 \\
	4
\end{array}
\right], t1 = \left[26\right]
\right\}
\]

\[
\left\{ 
p2 = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
	4 \\
	2
\end{array}
\right], t2 = \left[26\right]
\right\}
\]

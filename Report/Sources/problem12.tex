\section{Problem 12}

In order to evaluate the expression "\verb|not(A(x) OR B(x))|", we first have to take a look in how fuzzy logic is different with binary logic at the operation level.
In binary logic we have three basic operations: \verb*|AND(x,y)|, \verb*|OR(x,y)| and \verb*|NOT(x)|. But, in fuzzy logic, where a function can have a value in range of $\left[0..1\right]$, things are a bit different.
Operation \verb*|AND(x,y)| of binary is equivalent with \verb|MIN(x,y)| from the fuzzy logic, \verb*|OR(x,y)| with \verb*|MAX(x,y)| and \verb*|NOT(x)| with \verb|1-x|.

Taking a look into the functions \verb*|A| and \verb*|B| from figure~\ref{}
